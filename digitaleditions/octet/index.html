var poem_1 = [
"The running of the river",
"Was broken up by the sudden burst",
"Of noise: like thunder, like gunfire.",
"The current stopped, momentarily,",
"Frozen in fractured time,",
"Cut off from source of motion,",
"Lolling in ancient stillness",
"That felt new, new—",
"New like a thrift store coat",
"Washed clean of must and mothball",
"Ghosts and sprayed thoroughly",
"With aerosol angel descenters.",
"There was no more flow,",
"No rush and rumble;",
"Just glassy water in statuesque stillness",
"And rocks beneath the clear facade",
"Halted mid-tumble, floating,",
"Like dulled bronze balloons",
"Hung ornaments for crawfish",
"And salamanders.",
"",
"She looked up from the bottom of the gorge",
"And",
"Spied the spores of smoke",
"Rising up from a castle of flame,",
"And smiled, inexplicably,",
"Despite herself.",
"The explosion was silent,",
"Unalarming, a sliver of ice",
"Beneath the snow of cloud-blanked sky,",
"A hiccup of the gods.",
"",
"The world came to a stop,",
"But she was still moving,",
"Skirt blowing in the wind",
"And foraging basket full of mushrooms",
"Swaying gently as her arms swung",
"Akimbo, relaxed, and she gazed on",
"At the plume or upwards incineration",
"Burning up motion and rendering entropy unto naught."
];

poem_2 = [
  "He was near the summit,",
  "Boots well broken in by now,",
  "Soles softened and toes blistered,",
  "Heels calloused and littered with rough pink patches",
  "Wrought by strenuous hike.",
  "The pine wall broken,",
  "Bare rock above and all around him,",
  "Gray slate and shale",
  "Crunching smooth and crumbling underfoot,",
  "His journey was nearing its end.",
  "The snow-slapped peak stretched out languorously before him,",
  "Beckoning its conquering,",
  "When the wind stopped.",
  "",
  "The birds froze, too, halted mid-flight:",
  "Wings laid out like a book",
  "With broken spine hanging limply open,",
  "Unread. The fir branches shivered,",
  "Still, the pines feinting movement despite",
  "Their incapacitation. The sky",
  "Bled still-slipping clouds",
  "And shed its bright blue hue",
  "Like snake skin.",
  "The flames in the distance gave him pause,",
  "And he found himself unable to continue to climb."

];

poem_3 = [

"The grass brushed against their knees",
"Like paintbrush horsehair into fresh canvas",
"Pushing thin paint into freshly stretched white",
"Dyeing the unreflecting mirror",
"With colors of crushed earth",
"Overturned by the bare feet",
"Running in cycles of pitterpat",
"Frenzy over the soft-packed soul,",
"Still moist from yesterday’s rain.",
"They ran like thunder,",
"Like horses spooked by a sudden",
"Glint of the sun against gunmetal;",
"Like fireflies burning with the leftover",
"Sparks of the faded sun,",
"They fluttered around the field,",
"Harried but free.",
"Joy filled their footfalls,",
"Resounded from their soles",
"Like laughter,",
"Their song of motion,",
"Of effortless, natural dance."
];

poem_4 = [
  "The snails and salamanders curled around her feet",
  "Like whirlpools of living matter",
  "Suckling from skin of toe and ankle.",
  "She has seen life ebb and fade like",
  "The swirling waters, has seen",
  "Friends sink into grave like tadpoles",
  "Into hollows of mud and stone,",
  "Has seen breath cease as the wind picks up",
  "And blows frail bodies, or ashes,",
  "Into the oblivion of the far-off distance,",
  "The beyond-sight,",
  "Sunk behind the broken masts of the sun’s failing ship",
  "As it dives under the horizon,",
  "Plummeting downwards to plumb depths",
  "Of earth we cannot fathom,",
  "Apollo says,",
  "Although he is sometimes called a liar.",
  "And Apollo now seems present",
  "In the great billowing chimneystack of fire",
  "And smoke that flings itself upwards",
  "Towards the heavens",
  "(Not down, eyes averted, like self-sacrificing sun),",
  "Unafraid,",
  "Unrelenting,",
  "Hurtling toward what it claims unrepentantly as its own,",
  "Destiny of cloud and cinder."
];

poem_5 = [
  "We are swayed and sing and bow down",
  "Beneath the bucking whiplash of the winds",
  "That brush through us like ghosts,",
  "Like phantasms of force and fury,",
  "That pry us open and pluck us from the festoons of forests",
  "For purposes unknown, molded by the whims of heaven.",
  "We are feted by the galing skies,",
  "Lifted up by the thin arms of heaven",
  "And laid on the breast of our mother,",
  "The altar of the earth,",
  "To suckle the milk of her unity, her peace.",
  "Until the light remains",
  "As the only thing standing",
  "In the ruins of a world once",
  "Sunken into darkness,",
  "We will sing to sustain it—",
  "To breathe life where",
  "There is would only be stillness,",
  "Or sorrow."
];

poem_6 = [
  "Crawling beneath soot-soaked earth",
  "The motion, ceaseless motion",
  "Of the life unspooling",
  "In ragged pools of flesh,",
  "Intertwining with roots and stones",
  "The troubled shake of limbless worm",
  "And the sticky-brittle contortions of beetles’ spiked legs,",
  "sickly sweet in their grace and violence like an",
 "Ice cream cone full of blood.",
  "Feeding trunks of ancient brood,",
  "Spitting nutrients up into their hallowed wood,",
  "The dirt gives life and eats the dead,",
  "Swallows sallow corpses like",
  "Clouds sucked into the sky:",
  "Empty, but filling,",
  "And free."

];

poem_7 = [
  "She cannot help but weep for her children,",
  "Arrayed in the golden thorns of the sun",
  "Bleeding light onto the earth like",
  "Waves of luminous rise and looping over",
  "Crashing downwards into sea,",
  "Light into light,",
  "Ocean into ocean,",
  "The salt of the sun spilled into",
  "Pool of effulgent sky.",
  "They run in circles,",
  "Look up at her face imploringly,",
  "Cover eyes and avert gaze downwards,",
  "Raise calloused hands in desperate",
  "Appeals to heaven.",
  "The pillar of smoke rises",
  "To the firmament like a letter",
  "Penned by hands of flame and ash,",
  "Missive shooting missile",
  "In tower of stillness and conflagration."
];

poem_8 = [
  "The stillness of the wind and trees",
  "And birds did not startled him.",
  "He had come to expect the unusual",
  "And unexpected in the woods",
  "That he waded through like a prayer",
  "Through the wilds of spiritual being,",
  "Wandering and wafting toward its intended target like an invisible letter of love and devotion,",
  "Want and need,",
  "Unease and calm,",
  "Communication and silence.",
  "",
  "The smoke  rose above him first—",
  "Then he saw the flames flickering up",
  "Towards the base of the blast,",
  "Peeking fiery heads above the tree line—",
  "Then the shockwave of bursting boom",
  "Hit him in the chest and froze bones temporarily into reverberating tremors of startled silence.",
  "But he continued to walk,",
  "Even through the shaking boom—",
  "His legs seemed to carry him forward of their own accord.",
  "",
  "Eventually the birdsong and fluttering of wings",
  "And flittering flights from nest to protruding worm resumed,",
  "And the springs again gurgled and the squirrels leapt and played and chittered",
  "And the spiders wove nests like tapestries of living art,",
  "Their lives inseparable from their creation.",
  "And the walker strode on,",
  "Content to be moving,",
  "Moving into a present that was ever-unfolding into itself,",
  "Into him and others and the trees and birds and air and soil,",
  "That was at once all and nothing,",
  "An eternal symphony without an end."
